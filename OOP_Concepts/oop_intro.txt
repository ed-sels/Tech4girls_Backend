OOP

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of designing and organizing code that simulates real-world objects and systems.
OOP makes it easier to design and develop complex software systems by providing a framework for organizing and structuring code

The Four Main Principles of OOP:

1. Encapsulation: Hides internal details and protects data.
2. Abstraction: Shows only necessary information and reduces complexity.
3. Inheritance: Allows code reuse by inheriting properties from other classes.
4. Polymorphism: Enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.

Benefits of OOP in software development:

1. Modularity: Makes code easier to maintain and update.
2. Reusability: Saves time and effort by reusing code.
3. Easier Troubleshooting: Helps identify and isolate issues more efficiently.

Real-World Examples:

1. Banking System: Uses OOP to model customers, accounts, and transactions.
2. Vehicle Management: Uses OOP to represent vehicles, drivers, and routes.
3.Online shopping platform:uese OOP to model products, customers, orders and payments, making it easier to manage and scale the platform
